Bank Customer Churn Prediction: Leveraging Machine Learning for Business Insights

Project Goals:

1. Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and identify key factors contributing to churn.

2. Develop a scalable and interpretable model to provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

Project Process:
1. Data Collection: Gathered dataset from the bank's customer database containing information such as demographics, account balance, and transaction history.
2. Data Preprocessing: Removed irrelevant features and converted categorical variables into numerical data using label encoding.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

> Analyzed the distribution of key features such as credit score, age, tenure, balance, and number of products among churned and non-churned customers.

>Visualized relationships between features and churn using box plots, histograms, and count plots.

4. Model Building and Training:

> Utilized logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest classifiers to build predictive models.

> Evaluated model performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

5. Model Optimization:
> Conducted hyperparameter tuning using grid search with cross-validation to optimize the random forest classifier.

> Employed feature selection based on feature importance to improve model efficiency.

6. Model Evaluation:
> Assessed the performance of the optimized model on the test dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 84.56%.

Details of Features:

1. Demographic Information: Includes customer's age, gender, and geographical location (encoded numerically).

2. Financial Metrics: Consist of credit score, account balance, tenure, and number of products.

3. Customer Behavior: Indicates whether the customer is an active member and their usage of banking products.

Skills Utilized:

1. Programming Language: Proficient in Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
2. Data Manipulation: Used pandas library for data manipulation, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
3. Data Visualization: Employed matplotlib and seaborn libraries for visualizing data distributions and relationships.
4. Machine Learning: Applied scikit-learn library for building, training, and optimizing machine learning models.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Conducted grid search with cross-validation for optimizing model hyperparameters.
6. Feature Selection: Utilized SelectFromModel method to select relevant features based on feature importance.
7. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: Employed analytical skills to understand business problems and develop effective solutions.

Conclusion:
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to address real-world business challenges, specifically in predicting customer churn for a bank. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, actionable insights can be derived to improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall business performance.
